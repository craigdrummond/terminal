This is a readme for the repository

Up until chapter 16 this application was a text application run inside the
Eclipse UI.  Starting with the branch gui this application and the rest of 
the code written in this repository will be converted to run inside of the
graphical user interface.

This will be a challenge but it should help us learn Java GUI programming
